[done 20140612] on config tool:
	BUG: back does not work properly and yields many issues - network fields - checkboxes - change in number of infiles - etc.

on config tool:
	change the wording 
	change the final step (launching the webapp)
	when defining fields for the out-file structure:
		only allow for fields defined in the in-file structure -- LISTE DEROULANTE

on config tool + netgen:
	for the oufile: 
		add the possibility to keep in the first row the names of the fields
	for the infile:
		add the possibility to generate the structure based on the first row of the files

on web app:
	make "try except" cases to return bugs and issues in the log file

on config file:
	let the possibility for the user to make a default mapping command (applied to all fields)

on full-web version:
	garbage collector - project cleaner

[done 20140612 - related to the BACK issue] on config tool:
	check the out-file fields reference to the in-file files: 
		there was an issue when more then 1 file -- Valentin

	@ BuBa:
		test the online configuration tool
		test the new version of netgen 

syncing the new config file:
	to add in netgen: 
		new field "all". "all" = take all the outfiles
		new parameter : "mapping_out_files_name" to specify the relation btw mapping process and out files. 

on netgen: file and data handler:
	expand the cases of different formats (csv, xls, etc.)

on netmint: 
	allow for a characterization of more fields : 
		more then 1 info in edges 
		info on the nodes

on netgen-fullweb:
	revise val's code for the generation of zip files etc.
